# Hugo Bootstrap v4 Blog [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/alanorth/hugo-theme-bootstrap4-blog.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/alanorth/hugo-theme-bootstrap4-blog)
A simple [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) theme based on the [Bootstrap v4 blog example](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/examples/blog). Opinionated and geared towards blog-style content.

- Configurable display of summaries of content in list templates.

## Usage
Clone the repository to your site's `themes` directory. Refer to [`exampleSite/config.toml`](https://github.com/alanorth/hugo-theme-bootstrap4-blog/blob/master/exampleSite/config.toml) for recommended configuration values.

## Content Suggestions
A few suggestions to help you get a good looking site quickly:

- Keep blog posts in the `content/post` directory, for example: `content/post/my-first-post.md`
- Keep static pages in the `content` directory, for example: `content/about.md`
- Keep media like images in the `static` directory, for example: `static/2016/10/screenshot.png`
- If you want an image to be shown when you share a post on social media, specify at least one image in the post's front matter, for example: `images: ["/2016/10/screenshot.png"]`
- Use the `<!--more-->` tag in posts to control how much of a post is shown on summary pages
- Disable comments on a post by setting `comments = false` in its frontmatter
- Disable social sharing icons site wide (or on individual pages/posts) by setting `sharingicons = false`
- If your content is stored in git, add `enableGitInfo = true` to your site config and Hugo will use git history to set a more accurate modification date in page metadata

## Building (For Developers)
This theme uses the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework. A static version of this is already included, but if you want to bump the version, tweak the style, etc, you'll need to rebuild the assets. Make sure you have NodeJS v6 or v7 installed, and then run the following from inside the theme's directory:

```console
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

## Contributing
There are several ways to help with the development of the theme:

- [Open an issue](https://github.com/alanorth/hugo-theme-bootstrap4-blog/issues/new) on GitHub if you have problems or feature requests
- Alternatively, tackle one of the [existing issues](https://github.com/alanorth/hugo-theme-bootstrap4-blog/issues) on the issue tracker
- Fork [the repository](https://github.com/alanorth/hugo-theme-bootstrap4-blog) on GitHub, add features on a "feature" branch like `update-bootstrap`, and then send a [pull request](https://github.com/alanorth/hugo-theme-bootstrap4-blog/compare) with your changes
